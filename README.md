Here’s a simple **README.md** you can use for your GitHub repo:

# Google Drive PDF Downloader

This Python script downloads images from a Google Drive file preview and compiles them into a PDF.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:
  - selenium
  - Pillow
  - fpdf2
  - webdriver-manager

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Usage

The script takes **3 arguments**:

1. **Google Drive file URL** – the link to the file you want to download.
2. **Image folder** – the folder where the downloaded images will be saved.
3. **PDF file path** – the full path (including filename) where the final PDF will be saved.

---

### Sample Command

```bash
python downloader.py "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JmzbGrCIPiiJzPMPENClHHuhX4OoYJAe/view" "E:\__init__()\__Job_prep__\Jahid Sakib course\img" "E:\__init__()\__Job_prep__\Jahid Sakib course\JFET (full).pdf"
```

* This will download the images from the given Google Drive link into the folder:

```
E:\__init__()\__Job_prep__\Jahid Sakib course\img
```

* Then it will compile them into the PDF:

```
E:\__init__()\__Job_prep__\Jahid Sakib course\JFET (full).pdf
```

---

## Notes

* Make sure the **image folder exists** or the script will create it.
* Only pass a **full PDF filename** in the third argument — passing a folder alone will cause a `PermissionError`.
* Avoid having parentheses `()` in folder names if possible, as some systems may misinterpret them.
